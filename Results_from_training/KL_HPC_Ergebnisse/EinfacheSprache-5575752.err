2022-04-20 15:07:47.846602: I tensorflow/core/platform/cpu_feature_guard.cc:152] This TensorFlow binary is optimized with oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library (oneDNN) to use the following CPU instructions in performance-critical operations:  SSE3 SSE4.1 SSE4.2 AVX
To enable them in other operations, rebuild TensorFlow with the appropriate compiler flags.

Some layers from the model checkpoint at ./bert-base-german-cased were not used when initializing TFBertModel: ['nsp___cls', 'mlm___cls']
- This IS expected if you are initializing TFBertModel from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing TFBertModel from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
All the layers of TFBertModel were initialized from the model checkpoint at ./bert-base-german-cased.
If your task is similar to the task the model of the checkpoint was trained on, you can already use TFBertModel for predictions without further training.
